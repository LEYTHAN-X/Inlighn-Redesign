## ✨ UI/UX Highlights

### 🔥 Animations & Effects

- **Fade, slide & zoom animations** using `AOS` and Tailwind utilities.
- **Progressive blur effects**: On hover, non-selected cards blur subtly while the active one glows.
- **Liquid/Fluid animations**: Glowing blob animations in background and footer, creating a modern flowing effect.
- **Login Skeleton Effect**: Simulates a loading state before the login form appears for enhanced realism.
- **Hover scaling & glow effects**: Buttons and cards elevate and glow softly with shadow effects.
- **Scroll-based triggers**: Elements animate into view on scroll using AOS.
- **Floating background blobs**: Create a sense of depth and motion across the site.

### 🎨 Design Aesthetics

- **Dark Mode UI**: Clean and consistent color palette with gradients and dark tones.
- **Glowing UI components**: Gradients and shadows give a futuristic vibe to buttons, cards, and badges.
- **Responsive layout**: Fully optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
